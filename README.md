## 🎓 Learning:
Excited to share that I've learned how to create a minimalist design with a sliding navbar on hover, and I've included a filter and cart bar in the navigation! I've also optimized the navbar for tablets and mobile devices to make it more accessible for everyone. It's great to see my web design skills improving.
